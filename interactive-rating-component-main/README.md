### What I learned

During this project I learned all about radio buttons, namely how to style them and how to process their inputs. I also played around with some animation. I implemented some button transition animations and a flip animation on displaying the thank you block. I used the `translateY()` CSS function together with the `:hover` selector for the radio button transition animations. I used a combination of the `::before`, `::after` and `:hover` selectors together with the `translate()` CSS function to implement the sumbit button transition animation. Lastly, I used the `@keyframes` rule and the `rotateY()` CSS function for the thank you block animation.
