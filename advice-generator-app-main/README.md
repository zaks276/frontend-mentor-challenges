## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Javascript
-   Advice Slip API

### What I learned

While completing this project I learnt how to connect the frontend to an API by means of the Javascript Fetch API. I also learned about async functions, Javascript promises and how to process the response from the Fetch API with the `.json()` method. Lastly, I learned how execute a function on window load with the `addEventListener()` method.

### Continued development

For future projects I definitely want to play around with API's more. I also want to deepen my understanding of asynchronous functions and Javascript promises.

### Useful resources

-   [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.javascript.info) - A helpful resource for all things Javascript.
-   [JavaScript Fetch API](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp) - A basic introduction to the modern Javascript Fetch API.
-   [MDN Docs Response.json()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json) - Great documentation for a very useful method of the Fetch API response interface.
